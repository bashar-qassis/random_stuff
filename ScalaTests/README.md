# Scala Tests
is a group of worksheets and classes that I built while learning functional programming in Scala from the course Functional Programming Principles in Scala, https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/welcome, mostly these are answers to some of the pop quizzes in the lectures of the course.
