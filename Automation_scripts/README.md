# Automation Scripts
These are a bunch of random small scripts that I made to help me automate some routine (somewhat boring) tasks.

## update_mirrors
is a Shellscript that updates the mirrorlist used by Pacman on ArchLinux, it's quite a simple task but it's boring one, having to use two of the same commands everytime I notice that the mirrorlist was updated. It also creates a backup of the old mirrorlist in case things go haywire!!

## fill_missing.py
I'm taking the practical training course in my university, and we are required to report each day we're at work on our universit y academic portal (Ritaj), but the online report tool was opened about 10 days late, and I am just not gonna go on filling those days one by one, so this script uses the Selenium tool to automatically fill those 10 days, since all share almost identical details.
